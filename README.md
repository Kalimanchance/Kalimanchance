- 👋 Hi, I’m @Kalimanchance
- 👀 I’m interested in reverse engineering, and learning machine language by way of debugging, etc. most of all i love to figure out ways to do things with software/devices that was not originally intended, and customizing android and it's. also an avid gamer and voracious reader.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning c#, albeit superficially; just enough to understand what i read while using idapro. my main language is all things java.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on custom roms, contributing to and keeping relevant the android rooting community, and especially defeating the evil corporations like samsung who single out the U.S. by way of arbitrarily locking down our bootloaders in their flagship devices, while any other country is allowed this freedom to customize their Sammy devices on a whim. I'm a firm believer of "if i pay for it full price i should have the right to access my device as low level as I want.

- 😄 Pronouns: Human lol
- ⚡ Fun fact: I process information and learn patterns and processes like an engineer, but cannot tie my shoes the old fashioned way.
